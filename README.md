[ðŸŽ¥ Framed](https://framed.wtf/)
â€“ [ðŸŽ® GuessThe.game](https://guessthe.game/)
â€“ [ðŸ”Š Guess The Audio](https://guesstheaudio.com/)
â€“ [Episode](https://episode.wtf/)
)
2. plus a utility script to aggregate / share the results

_TitleQuest_ is just a plain HTML file that you can open in any browser.

Take note that some features are not available in some browsers, unless the HTML is served by a webserver. Alternatively a Go script is provided, to self-serve the HTML file at http://localhost:8080 and then open the default browser window.

## How to run 

Double click the `index.html` file.

Alternatively, run the Go server, if self-serving the HTML is required:

```
$ go run .
```

## How to build

Only the Go server needs a build step.

```
$ go build -ldflags="-s -w"

$ .\titlequest.go.exe
```
