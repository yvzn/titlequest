_TitleQuest_ is just a plain HTML file that you can open in any browser.

Take note that some features are not available in some browsers, unless the HTML is served by a webserver. To solve this issue, a Go app can self-serve the HTML file at http://localhost:8080.

## How to run 

Double click the `index.html` file.

To run the Go app / server (if required):

```
$ go run .
```

## How to build

Only the Go app / server needs a build step.

```
$ go build -ldflags="-s -w"

$ .\titlequest.go.exe
```
